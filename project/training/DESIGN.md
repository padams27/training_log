TO THE USER:

THE DESIGN OF MY WEBSITE IS BASED OFF OF THE LAYOUT OF THE 'FINANCE' PSET. FROM WHICH I HAVE ALSO USE THE 'HELPERS' FILE AND
THE LOGIN FUNCTION. THE MAIN REGISTER, LOGIN AND LOGOUT ARE ALSO FROM FINANCE. AFTER THE INPUTS OF REGISTRTION THE ONLY
OTHER 'POST' METHOD IS FROM THE ADD PAGE, OTHERWSIE THE REST OF THE PAGES INVOLVE DISPLAYING THE ADDED DATA FOR EASY COMPARISON.
EACH OF THE OTHER PAGES USES DIFFERENT PYHTON AND SQL SEARCH REQUESTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE CORRESPONDING HTML FILES WITH
DATA RELEVANT TO THEIR TABLES. USING FLASK ETC IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE TABLES WORK WAS CERTIANLY ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS OF
IMPLEMENTATION.

FOR SQL I MADE TWO TABLES LINKED BY A FOREIGN KEY - ONE FOR THE REGISTRATION INFORMATION AND THE OTHER FOR THE TRAINING DATA.
TO TAKE THE PROJECT FURTHER IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ADD MORE FIELDS/COLUMNS TO THE TRAINING DATABASE SUCH AS WORKOUT HEARTRATE
OR MILES TRAVELLED (FOR RUN AND BIKE).

THE DESIGN OF THE WEBPAGE IS ALSO BASED OFF OF THE PLATFORM OF FINANCE'S DISTRIBUTION CODE, AND WHILE KEEPING THE LAYOUT 'CLEAN'
I HAVE MADE CHANGES THAT CUSTOMISE THE SITE TO OUR (HARVARD) COLOURS IN CSS.

I HAVE USED SOME JAVA SCRIPT AS WELL WHERE THE TRAINING 'TYPE' IS INPUTED IN THE FORM OF A DROP DOWN MENU.

AT THE MOMENT THE PAGE, ALTHOUGH I THINK IT LOOKS NICE AND CLEAN/SIMPLE, IS POTENTAILLY A BIT DULL AND COULD MAYBE HAVE A BACKGROUND IMAGE
OR SOMETHING ELSE TO MAKE IT MORE EXCITING.
