# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Winter training challenge

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows you to log minutes traing, type of excercise etc. It will then have a main page that displays the results.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Take a team of 30 athletes and divide it into 6 groups of 5. Each team has its own page displaying a runnig update of the most recent training. This would display
times spent trainng and excersie type. On one main 'front page' will be displayed a leaderboard with links to each other page. While making the website with html
and css would be managable, imputting the data and storing the it all using javascript would be less straightforward.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

not applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

To have a functioning website (layout etc.), making the imputted data with different parameters and having them update to a differnt page may be challenginng.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To be able to put in data and have in succesfully update between pages and record in a easy to read manner

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To have a functioning, easy to use platform that would be as good as using an excel spreadsheet.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Get better at using javascript, or maybe look into using a different source. Also get better with html and css so that the website layout is quicker and easier to acheive.
